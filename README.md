## Getting started

First, set up Django and Django REST, following the detailed instructions at the [Mr. Vincent's post](https://wsvincent.com/django-rest-framework-authentication-tutorial/). Once you have Django up and running, clone this repository then run `npm install`. Once that's done, run `npm run start` to launch [WebPack Dev Server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/). Open a browser window and enter `http://localhost:8080` as the location.
